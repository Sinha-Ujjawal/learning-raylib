## Playing around with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) by implementing simple examples
This repository is intended to have list of example codes in Raylib. This is purely for recreational purpose only. Use these code with caution!

## Examples
- [Counter](./counter.c): This implements a simple counter that counts from [0, 99], and then repeats.
- [Psychophysicist's Electrode](./psychophysicists_electrode.c): This re-implements the [Psychophysicist's Electrode](https://github.com/Sinha-Ujjawal/aftereffects-the-psychophysicist-electrodes) github project, but in C using raylib.
- [Game Of Life](./game_of_life.c): This implements [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
